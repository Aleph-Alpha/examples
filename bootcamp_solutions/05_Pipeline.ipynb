Such assessments seek to develop information on changing economic, environmental and social conditions, pressures and responses, and their correlations with strategy objectives and indicators. These can build on existing tools including environmental assessments, cost-benefit analyses, accounting frameworks, etc. However, with the exception of a few countries, most national strategies lack provisions for systematically assessing the costs and benefits of alternative actions and informing trade-offs across the full range of sustainable development issues.\\n\\nThe most commonly used tools come from the environmental policy field. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) attempt to gauge the potential ecological effects of policies before they are implemented. In Canada, the Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals requires that government agencies incorporate environmental considerations in their reviews of various proposals, including positive and negative effects, and report these to the public. Other countries – including Denmark, Greece, Italy and Spain – use strategic environmental assessments (SEA) to discern potential outcomes. Ireland and Portugal employ SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis for sustainability assessments and priority setting.\\n\\nAnalysis of impacts and linkages can also be accomplished through budget mechanisms which reveal links between spending decisions and sustainable development impacts. In the Netherlands, each ministry is requested to give an overview of their contribution to sustainable development in their annual budget to be discussed in Parliament. Sweden, Norway and a few other countries have similar green budgeting approaches which outline the potential sustainable development impacts related to public spending on proposed policies and programmes.\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n---\\nANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENTS\\n\\nMore sophisticated analytical tools are now being tried in certain countries. Switzerland uses a new tool, Strategic Sustainability Assessments, in its planning processes to review sustainable development linkages and the overall effects of potential policies and actions. Similarly, the European Union strategy advocates assessments of major legislative proposals, which should include, where relevant, the effects of gender equality and equal opportunities and identify the groups who bear the burden of change so that policy makers can judge the need for measures to help these groups adapt. The United Kingdom maintains a central interdepartmental requirement linked to regulatory assessments for evaluating the sustainability impacts of policies.\\n\\n'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id=11, version=0, score=0.08662788925540957, payload={'text': ' MONITORING AND EVALUATION\\n\\nNational strategies for sustainable development are not meant to be static plans. Rather, they should evolve as more information becomes available about priorities, technological options and policy cost- effectiveness and in order to overcome problems in implementation. Learning, adaptation and continual improvement should be characteristics of national strategies. This requires a process to monitor strategy implementation, to report to governing bodies and stakeholders, and to feed back information for adjustments and improvements. For example, Austria has committed to a “Learning Strategy” which emphasises reporting and communication in order to widen participation in the development and implementation of the national sustainable development strategy.\\n\\nBoth Canada and the United Kingdom have opted for an independent auditing process as learning tools for sustainable development. In Canada, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) in the Office of the Auditor General is responsible for reporting to Parliament on the extent to which departments are implementing and achieving the objectives laid out in their sustainable development strategies. These strategies must be reviewed, revised and retabled every three years, providing a regular opportunity for learning and adaptation.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the role of the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), established in 2000, was strengthened in 2005 to change it from “critical friend” to “watchdog” utilising both the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission to oversee implementation of the national strategy. New Zealand has appointed a similar but more limited Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, who primarily audits the Environment Ministry.\\n\\nOther countries are also developing oversight bodies. Belgium attributed this task to the Federal Planning Bureau where a task force periodically reports on the quality of the federal government’s sustainable development policies and programmes. Belgium adopted a legal framework in 1997 instituting a process of consecutive rounds of reporting, planning, consultation and monitoring of policies. In 2004, Germany established a\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n\\n\\nParliamentary Committee for Sustainable Development which calls plenary debates and gives recommendations to the federal government regarding strategy implementation.\\n\\nFrance has a unique peer review process to promote experience sharing with other countries in support of the continuous improvement of its national strategy. It developed a methodology and subjected its own strategy to a peer review in February 2005 by a group including four peer partner countries – Belgium, Ghana, Mauritius and the United Kingdom. The peers made 13 general and 42 specific recommendations including how to promote sustainable development partnerships with developing countries, establish more participatory processes and ensure effective monitoring of the national sustainable development strategy. The French hope “that this approach will be found to have generic value that can be used (and developed further) by other countries through similar exercises.”\\n'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id=8, version=0, score=0.06342945391335139, payload={'text': ' LOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\nSustainable development strategies should involve local authorities and be a two-way iterative process between national and decentralised levels. The main strategic principles and directions should be set at the central level, but more detailed planning, implementation and monitoring can also be undertaken at a decentralised level, with appropriate transfer of resources and authority. But promoting sustainable development effectively when governments with different geographical jurisdictions may be pursuing various agendas is complex. Only a few OECD governments have attempted to catalyse and fully co-ordinate with the sustainable development efforts at sub-national government levels.\\n\\nCo-ordination among different levels of government, which is important for leveraging important changes, is inherently more difficult in federal states where powers over sustainable development policies are divided among levels of government. The institutional structure in federal countries\\n\\n- *e.g.,* Australia, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland – is different than those in more centralised countries and special procedures may be needed to implement sustainable development strategies. In Belgium, for example, the federal government has adopted a formal Strategy for Sustainable Development, while the communities and regions have integrated the principles of sustainable development into their strategic plans.\\n\\nSome countries have developed separate but equal approaches for devolved regions. The United Kingdom developed a UK strategic framework for sustainable development, but emphasised delivery through a set of national strategies at the regional level covering the UK government and administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. France devotes attention to the “territories” in its sustainable development strategy which encompasses both regional and sub-regional levels of government.\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\nLOCAL AND REGIONAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\nCountries such as France and Portugal have fully included local and regional authorities in the preparation of their national sustainable development strategies. The United Kingdom has a strong local component in its strategy, including Local Strategic Partnerships and Sustainable Community Plans. Some countries, *e.g.* Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Korea, are co-ordinating national and local implementation of sustainable development strategies through local Agenda 21 processes. Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 contains guidance for local initiatives in support of its overall goals where local authorities are asked to develop their own sub-strategies to suit their economies and specific circumstances.\\n\\n'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id=7, version=0, score=0.046333538811502206, payload={'text': ' CO-ORDINATION AND INSTITUTIONS\\n\\nAchieving sustainable development depends a great deal on high-level political commitment, well-functioning government institutions and overcoming co-ordination failures in public policies. Involving and co- ordinating a wide range of government departments allows strategies to take a broad view of issues, give voice to a range of dispersed interests and develop trade-offs across policy areas. Most OECD countries have set up inter-agency or inter-ministerial co-ordinating committees for sustainable development, which provide an overarching integrative body and framework for action.\\n\\nAlso important is where responsibility is placed for overseeing the co- ordinating mechanism and the different participating agencies. In most OECD countries, overall responsibility for strategy implementation is housed in the Ministry of Environment either directly or indirectly through a co-ordinating committee which it oversees. This is true for countries such as Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although the United Kingdom replaced its Green Cabinet with a Sustainable Development Cabinet, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) leads the preparation of sustainable development strategies and manages implementation across the government.\\n\\nA good practice is to assign overall co-ordination to a Prime Minister’s office or the equivalent which has greater authority to demand inputs and resolve conflicts than line ministries. France, Finland, Portugal and Germany have placed responsibility for their national sustainable development strategies directly under the Prime Minister’s office to achieve maximum coherence. In the Belgian federal government, the responsibility for strategy implementation is under the State Secretary for Sustainable Development who chairs the Interdepartmental Committee for Sustainable Development (ICDO) including all federal departments.\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\nCO-ORDINATION AND INSTITUTIONS\\n\\nAnother approach is to assign responsibility for national sustainability strategies to Finance Ministries, which can assure that strategic management is linked to fiscal priority setting, national expenditure and revenue generation. Thus, Norway has placed responsibility for its sustainable development plan in the Ministry of Finance, while in the Czech Republic, the Governmental Council for Sustainable Development is chaired by the Deputy Minister for Economic Affairs, and in Italy, the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning, which is responsible for sustainable development, is chaired by the Minister of Economy and Finance.\\n\\n'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id=5, version=0, score=0.04122372045744385, payload={'text': \" INTERGENERATIONAL TIMEFRAME\\n\\nIn addition to balancing economic, environmental and social objectives, a basic tenet of sustainable development is the need to balance the needs of current and future generations. This is reflected in the definition of sustainable development from the 1987 Brundtlandt Report as “meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”. For well-being to last, the stocks of assets that underpin it *(e.g.,* man-made, natural, human and social capital) must be preserved over time. National strategies for sustainable development need a long timeframe for implementing notions of intergenerational equity, a fundamental principle of sustainable development.\\n\\nThe national strategies of most countries have specific short-term timeframes *(e.g.* 2000-2005). Others have medium-term timeframes of ten years, *e.g.,* the Czech Republic Strategy for Sustainable Development covers the years 2004 to 2014. While this may facilitate monitoring progress on specific goals and dealing with short- and medium-term change, it leaves national strategies open to political vulnerabilities. Although some strategies have an inherent renewal expectation or periodic renewals required by law, they may still be subject to the ideological or political whims of successive governments. Strategic planning frameworks are more likely to be successful when they are based on a long-term vision backed by a strong and lasting political commitment.\\n\\nTo this end, some countries have taken timeframes of 20 to 30 years in their national strategies for sustainable development. Sweden's strategy has a 25-year planning perspective, while allowing that measures taken in accordance with the strategy may need to be reassessed more frequently. The Danish strategy contains objectives and benchmarks for a 20-year timeframe, while the German strategy developed in 2002 contains quantified and time-bound indicators extending to 2020. Iceland’s national strategy also extends from 2002 to 2020 and is meant to be a dynamic document responding to changes in circumstances and emphasis. The perspective of Poland’s strategy is given in its title, *Poland 2025: Long-Term Strategy for Sustainable Development.*\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n\\nWhile a longer timeframe allows for better incorporation of intergenerational considerations, these are difficult to define and quantify. Finland and a few other countries have included indicators relating to intergenerational concerns in their strategies. In economic terms, these might relate to relieving public debt, in environmental terms, concern for the preservation of resources, and in social terms, the provision of adequate retirement incomes. For the environmental dimension, for example, the Swedish strategy states that “the overall objective of environmental policy is to hand over a society to the next generation in which the major environmental problems have been solved”. The French strategy advocates intergenerational solidarity with a focus on caring for the elderly and facilitating the transmission of competencies across generations.\\n\\n\"}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id=10, version=0, score=0.01384185811949451, payload={'text': ' INDICATORS AND TARGETS\\n\\nThe development and incorporation of quantitative indicators can help remove discrepancies between the intentions set out in national strategies and what is or can be realised in practice.

According to an assessment of the status of national strategies in 2004, only 12% of a total of 191 countries had strategies which were being implemented (UN DESA, 2004). However, another 24% had strategy\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n\\n# National strategies in OECD countries\\n\\nAs for the 30 OECD countries, most have developed national sustainable development strategies in some form.

Of these, Australia, Finland, France, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom formulated strategies relatively early and some *(e.g.,* the United Kingdom) have since revised their strategies. Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the Slovak Republic prepared their first national strategies more recently.\\n\\nIn 2001, the European Union also developed a sustainable development strategy for its Member countries (under revision in 2006), while a Nordic Strategy for Sustainable Development (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) was revised in 2005.\\n\\nSeven OECD countries do not have national sustainable development strategies as such – Belgium, Canada, Hungary, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and the United States. In federal countries such as Belgium and Canada, it is more difficult to develop a comprehensive national strategy. In Belgium, the federal government adopted a sustainable development strategy and is now in the process of developing a national strategy together with the governments of the regions and communities. Canada has adopted a decentralised approach, where 28 federal departments and agencies have enumerated sustainable development strategies, and is now formulating an overall national plan.\\n\\nMexico has integrated sustainable development elements into existing national development plans rather than develop a separate strategy. Hungary, Spain and Turkey are in the process of developing national sustainable development strategies.

Rather, they should evolve as more information becomes available about priorities, technological options and policy cost- effectiveness and in order to overcome problems in implementation. Learning, adaptation and continual improvement should be characteristics of national strategies. This requires a process to monitor strategy implementation, to report to governing bodies and stakeholders, and to feed back information for adjustments and improvements. For example, Austria has committed to a “Learning Strategy” which emphasises reporting and communication in order to widen participation in the development and implementation of the national sustainable development strategy.\\n\\nBoth Canada and the United Kingdom have opted for an independent auditing process as learning tools for sustainable development. In Canada, the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development (CESD) in the Office of the Auditor General is responsible for reporting to Parliament on the extent to which departments are implementing and achieving the objectives laid out in their sustainable development strategies. These strategies must be reviewed, revised and retabled every three years, providing a regular opportunity for learning and adaptation.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom, the role of the Sustainable Development Commission (SDC), established in 2000, was strengthened in 2005 to change it from “critical friend” to “watchdog” utilising both the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission to oversee implementation of the national strategy. New Zealand has appointed a similar but more limited Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, who primarily audits the Environment Ministry.\\n\\nOther countries are also developing oversight bodies. Belgium attributed this task to the Federal Planning Bureau where a task force periodically reports on the quality of the federal government’s sustainable development policies and programmes. Belgium adopted a legal framework in 1997 instituting a process of consecutive rounds of reporting, planning, consultation and monitoring of policies. In 2004, Germany established a\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n\\n\\nParliamentary Committee for Sustainable Development which calls plenary debates and gives recommendations to the federal government regarding strategy implementation.\\n\\nFrance has a unique peer review process to promote experience sharing with other countries in support of the continuous improvement of its national strategy.

The peers made 13 general and 42 specific recommendations including how to promote sustainable development partnerships with developing countries, establish more participatory processes and ensure effective monitoring of the national sustainable development strategy.

Such assessments seek to develop information on changing economic, environmental and social conditions, pressures and responses, and their correlations with strategy objectives and indicators. These can build on existing tools including environmental assessments, cost-benefit analyses, accounting frameworks, etc. However, with the exception of a few countries, most national strategies lack provisions for systematically assessing the costs and benefits of alternative actions and informing trade-offs across the full range of sustainable development issues.\\n\\nThe most commonly used tools come from the environmental policy field. Environmental impact assessments (EIA) attempt to gauge the potential ecological effects of policies before they are implemented. In Canada, the Cabinet Directive on the Environmental Assessment of Policy, Plan and Program Proposals requires that government agencies incorporate environmental considerations in their reviews of various proposals, including positive and negative effects, and report these to the public. Other countries – including Denmark, Greece, Italy and Spain – use strategic environmental assessments (SEA) to discern potential outcomes. Ireland and Portugal employ SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis for sustainability assessments and priority setting.\\n\\nAnalysis of impacts and linkages can also be accomplished through budget mechanisms which reveal links between spending decisions and sustainable development impacts. In the Netherlands, each ministry is requested to give an overview of their contribution to sustainable development in their annual budget to be discussed in Parliament. Sweden, Norway and a few other countries have similar green budgeting approaches which outline the potential sustainable development impacts related to public spending on proposed policies and programmes.\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n---\\nANALYSIS AND ASSESSMENTS\\n\\nMore sophisticated analytical tools are now being tried in certain countries. Switzerland uses a new tool, Strategic Sustainability Assessments, in its planning processes to review sustainable development linkages and the overall effects of potential policies and actions. Similarly, the European Union strategy advocates assessments of major legislative proposals, which should include, where relevant, the effects of gender equality and equal opportunities and identify the groups who bear the burden of change so that policy makers can judge the need for measures to help these groups adapt.

The main strategic principles and directions should be set at the central level, but more detailed planning, implementation and monitoring can also be undertaken at a decentralised level, with appropriate transfer of resources and authority. But promoting sustainable development effectively when governments with different geographical jurisdictions may be pursuing various agendas is complex. Only a few OECD governments have attempted to catalyse and fully co-ordinate with the sustainable development efforts at sub-national government levels.\\n\\nCo-ordination among different levels of government, which is important for leveraging important changes, is inherently more difficult in federal states where powers over sustainable development policies are divided among levels of government. The institutional structure in federal countries\\n\\n- *e.g.,* Australia, Belgium, Canada, Switzerland – is different than those in more centralised countries and special procedures may be needed to implement sustainable development strategies. In Belgium, for example, the federal government has adopted a formal Strategy for Sustainable Development, while the communities and regions have integrated the principles of sustainable development into their strategic plans.\\n\\nSome countries have developed separate but equal approaches for devolved regions. The United Kingdom developed a UK strategic framework for sustainable development, but emphasised delivery through a set of national strategies at the regional level covering the UK government and administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

Involving and co- ordinating a wide range of government departments allows strategies to take a broad view of issues, give voice to a range of dispersed interests and develop trade-offs across policy areas. Most OECD countries have set up inter-agency or inter-ministerial co-ordinating committees for sustainable development, which provide an overarching integrative body and framework for action.\\n\\nAlso important is where responsibility is placed for overseeing the co- ordinating mechanism and the different participating agencies. In most OECD countries, overall responsibility for strategy implementation is housed in the Ministry of Environment either directly or indirectly through a co-ordinating committee which it oversees. This is true for countries such as Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although the United Kingdom replaced its Green Cabinet with a Sustainable Development Cabinet, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) leads the preparation of sustainable development strategies and manages implementation across the government.\\n\\nA good practice is to assign overall co-ordination to a Prime Minister’s office or the equivalent which has greater authority to demand inputs and resolve conflicts than line ministries. France, Finland, Portugal and Germany have placed responsibility for their national sustainable development strategies directly under the Prime Minister’s office to achieve maximum coherence.

Thus, Norway has placed responsibility for its sustainable development plan in the Ministry of Finance, while in the Czech Republic, the Governmental Council for Sustainable Development is chaired by the Deputy Minister for Economic Affairs, and in Italy, the Interministerial Committee for Economic Planning, which is responsible for sustainable development, is chaired by the Minister of Economy and Finance.\\n\\n'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id=1, version=0, score=0.3013920712724311, payload={'text': ' INTRODUCTION\\n\\n# Background\\n\\nGovernments first agreed to prepare national sustainable development strategies as part of *Agenda 21,* signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio Earth Summit) in 1992.

Countries were urged to \"take immediate steps to make progress in the formulation and elaboration of NSDS and to begin their implementation by 2005\". In addition, integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes is one of the targets contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.\\n\\n# Current status of strategies\\n\\nAccording to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), much work remains to be done to reach the WSSD target that all countries should be in the process of implementing their NSDS by 2005. According to an assessment of the status of national strategies in 2004, only 12% of a total of 191 countries had strategies which were being implemented (UN DESA, 2004). However, another 24% had strategy\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n\\n# National strategies in OECD countries\\n\\nAs for the 30 OECD countries, most have developed national sustainable development strategies in some form. Internet links to national sustainable development strategies and plans in OECD countries are given in the Annex.\\n\\nTwenty-three OECD countries have prepared formal strategies or plans. Of these, Australia, Finland, France, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom formulated strategies relatively early and some *(e.g.,* the United Kingdom) have since revised their strategies. Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the Slovak Republic prepared their first national strategies more recently.\\n\\nIn 2001, the European Union also developed a sustainable development strategy for its Member countries (under revision in 2006), while a Nordic Strategy for Sustainable Development (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) was revised in 2005.\\n\\nSeven OECD countries do not have national sustainable development strategies as such – Belgium, Canada, Hungary, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and the United States. In federal countries such as Belgium and Canada, it is more difficult to develop a comprehensive national strategy. In Belgium, the federal government adopted a sustainable development strategy and is now in the process of developing a national strategy together with the governments of the regions and communities. Canada has adopted a decentralised approach, where 28 federal departments and agencies have enumerated sustainable development strategies, and is now formulating an overall national plan.\\n\\nMexico has integrated sustainable development elements into existing national development plans rather than develop a separate strategy. Hungary, Spain and Turkey are in the process of developing national sustainable development strategies. The United States has emphasized public/private sustainable development partnerships to promote economic growth, social development and environmental stewardship.\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n---\\n\\n'}, vector=None), ScoredPoint(id=4, version=0, score=0.28585770727176746, payload={'text': ' POLICY INTEGRATION\\n\\nPOLICY INTEGRATION – **15**\\n\\nSustainable development has been defined a variety of ways, but in practice it has come to mean development that achieves a balance among economic, environmental and social objectives for both present and future generations. The integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development is one of the most difficult balances to achieve in formulating a national strategy. In practice, most national strategies have a greater focus on environmental issues with some attempts to incorporate economic aspects. The social pillar has been the most neglected. As a result, few national strategies develop abilities for considering and making trade-offs among the three areas in overall policy-making.\\n\\nMost countries emphasize environmental components in their sustainable development strategies. For example, the main focus of the Danish strategy is on integrating environmental considerations into a number of specific sectors. The Australian Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development focuses on environmental concerns such as coastal zone management. Japan’s strategy is basically an environmental plan focused on materials recycling, global warming and biodiversity, while Korea’s strategy is based on the National Environmental Vision for the New Millennium. Canada has developed departmental strategies according to “A Guide to Green Government” to pursue the environmental health of the country.\\n\\nThe social element is the dimension the least integrated in national strategies. Whereas these often include social goals, sometimes with indicators, social objectives are generally listed alongside other objectives and rarely melded into a comprehensive strategy. There are also large differences across countries in how they interpret this notion – from a focus on the health consequences of environmental policies, to concerns about ethnic minorities and gender balance, to broader considerations about the quality of life, sustainable consumption and social relations (poverty, crime, employment, education).\\n\\nGOOD PRACTICES IN THE NATIONAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES OF OECD COUNTRIES – © OECD 2006\\n\\n---\\n\\nA few countries *(e.g.,* Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden) have succeeded in integrating social elements in their strategies. For example, in 2005, Germany outlined its progress on the Road Map for Sustainability, which addresses employment, ageing, pension and family issues as well as corporate social responsibility.\\n\\nSome countries have extended social considerations from the domestic to the international sphere. Norway counts among its social sustainability goals the need to increase development assistance and imports from developing countries. Portugal’s national strategy includes guidelines for reinforcing development co-operation, especially with Portuguese speaking countries, and moving towards the target of devoting 0.7% of GDP to official development aid.\\n\\n'}, vector=None)]\n"
