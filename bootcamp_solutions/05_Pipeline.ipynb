       " ' Overview\\n\\nDecision optimization is a mathematical technique used to help  \\nmake complex business decisions that have the potential for business disruption and involve many large data sources, multiple trade-  \\noff possibilities and complex constraints. This advanced analytics technique is often used for planning, scheduling and pricing, as well as other business applications. Organizations across the world have seen business value and high ROI from optimization, as demonstrated through successful projects in a wide range of industries.\\n\\nIBM Decision Optimization products enable business decision-  \\nmaking processes such as operational, tactical and strategic planning and scheduling. They can be used in a range of industries, including manufacturing, energy and utilities, finance and logistics. The  \\nDecision Optimization portfolio includes modeling tools, solvers  \\nand deployment capabilities to make decision optimization capabilities available for planning, scheduling and resource allocation scenarios.  \\nIt supports operations research experts with modeling activities in the mathematical, constraint programming and constraint-based scheduling model domain, and also facilitates collaboration between operations research experts and IT developers in their deployment needs. Business users can benefit from a tailored graphical user interface and access other advanced features like predictive analytics and machine learning, or business functions like control and execution systems, without having to worry about the underlying optimization technology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n',\n",

This enables the  \\nuser to understand what is possible and how much it would  \\ncost to do it, thereby providing great business advantage over  \\ncompetitors who base their decisions on heuristics or rules.\\n\\nThis analytical decision support toolkit supports rapid model development and solving by combining the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), the Optimization Programming Language (OPL) for modelling, and two solvers: IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimizer for mathematical programming models, and IBM ILOG CPLEX CP Optimizer for constraint programming and constraint-based scheduling models.\\n\\nThe core technologies of IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio provide:\\n\\n- Solutions for all sizes of optimization models, with no limit on the number of constraints and variables (although the size of the hardware limits the size of the model).\\n- Solutions in real time to support operational process requirements by providing unmatched performance of best-in-class algorithms.\\n- Multiple solver algorithms for different type of models to help choose the best algorithm for any specific situation. The mathematical programming solver provides LP, MIP and MIQCP algorithms, while the constraint solver provides solutions for models involving any type of constraints (including non-linear) over integer variables, as well as scheduling models over cumul functions (AKA resources) and interval variables (AKA activities).\\n- Optimal solutions and consistently short solution times across numerous problem instances. If the user wants  \\nto end the solve before optimality is proven, bounds and gaps are given, showing how close the potential optimum solution is (both for math and constraint programming).\\n- Ability to design interactive optimization models to adapt to real-world situations where data and business conditions change frequently.\\n\\nBusiness Goals  \\ntiming of activities\\n\\n*Figure 1.* The core technologies of IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.\\n\\n',\n",

While traditional software trials give users the ability to test the software, they generally have a strict time limit. In recognition of that, IBM now offers a free Community Edition, which gives users the freedom to fully test the software and run models with up to 1,000 variables and 1,000 constraints.\\n\\nIn the IBM Marketplace, users can download the free Community Edition by visiting ibm.biz/BdZ7Wx.

In addition, it now allows users to seamlessly connect to IBM cloud resources through IBM Decision Optimization on Cloud, which fuses the power of the on-premises Decision Optimization offering with the scalability of deployment on the IBM Cloud TM infrastructure.\\n\\nThis flexibility gives users of the on-premises IDE the ability to solve their optimization problems with any of the two solvers on the cloud from their desktop.
