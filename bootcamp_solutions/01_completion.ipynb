      " INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "# Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Governments first agreed to prepare national sustainable development strategies as part of *Agenda 21,* signed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio Earth Summit) in 1992. The purpose of these strategies was to translate the Summit’s ideas and commitments into concrete policies and actions. Governments agreed to “adopt national strategies for sustainable development [which should] build upon and harmonise the various sectoral, economic, social and environmental policies and plans that are operating in the country. Its goals should be to ensure socially responsible economic development for the benefit of future generations”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1997, the Special Session of the UN General Assembly met to review progress since the Rio Summit and set a target date of 2002 for introducing national sustainable development strategies. Subsequently, the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) noted the lack of progress in strategy development and implementation. Countries were urged to \"take immediate steps to make progress in the formulation and elaboration of NSDS and to begin their implementation by 2005\". In addition, integrating the principles of sustainable development into country policies and programmes is one of the targets contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Current status of strategies\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), much work remains to be done to reach the WSSD target that all countries should be in the process of implementing their NSDS by 2005. According to an assessment of the status of national strategies in 2004, only 12% of a total of 191 countries had strategies which were being implemented (UN DESA, 2004). However, another 24% had strategy\n",

      "# National strategies in OECD countries\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the 30 OECD countries, most have developed national sustainable development strategies in some form. Internet links to national sustainable development strategies and plans in OECD countries are given in the Annex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Twenty-three OECD countries have prepared formal strategies or plans. Of these, Australia, Finland, France, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom formulated strategies relatively early and some *(e.g.,* the United Kingdom) have since revised their strategies. Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal and the Slovak Republic prepared their first national strategies more recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2001, the European Union also developed a sustainable development strategy for its Member countries (under revision in 2006), while a Nordic Strategy for Sustainable Development (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) was revised in 2005.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seven OECD countries do not have national sustainable development strategies as such – Belgium, Canada, Hungary, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and the United States. In federal countries such as Belgium and Canada, it is more difficult to develop a comprehensive national strategy. In Belgium, the federal government adopted a sustainable development strategy and is now in the process of developing a national strategy together with the governments of the regions and communities. Canada has adopted a decentralised approach, where 28 federal departments and agencies have enumerated sustainable development strategies, and is now formulating an overall national plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mexico has integrated sustainable development elements into existing national development plans rather than develop a separate strategy. Hungary, Spain and Turkey are in the process of developing national sustainable development strategies. The United States has emphasized public/private sustainable development partnerships to promote economic growth, social development and environmental stewardship.\n",

      "Sustainable development has been defined a variety of ways, but in practice it has come to mean development that achieves a balance among economic, environmental and social objectives for both present and future generations. The integration of the three dimensions of sustainable development is one of the most difficult balances to achieve in formulating a national strategy. In practice, most national strategies have a greater focus on environmental issues with some attempts to incorporate economic aspects. The social pillar has been the most neglected. As a result, few national strategies develop abilities for considering and making trade-offs among the three areas in overall policy-making.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most countries emphasize environmental components in their sustainable development strategies. For example, the main focus of the Danish strategy is on integrating environmental considerations into a number of specific sectors. The Australian Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development focuses on environmental concerns such as coastal zone management. Japan’s strategy is basically an environmental plan focused on materials recycling, global warming and biodiversity, while Korea’s strategy is based on the National Environmental Vision for the New Millennium. Canada has developed departmental strategies according to “A Guide to Green Government” to pursue the environmental health of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The social element is the dimension the least integrated in national strategies. Whereas these often include social goals, sometimes with indicators, social objectives are generally listed alongside other objectives and rarely melded into a comprehensive strategy. There are also large differences across countries in how they interpret this notion – from a focus on the health consequences of environmental policies, to concerns about ethnic minorities and gender balance, to broader considerations about the quality of life, sustainable consumption and social relations (poverty, crime, employment, education).\n",

For example, in 2005, Germany outlined its progress on the Road Map for Sustainability, which addresses employment, ageing, pension and family issues as well as corporate social responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some countries have extended social considerations from the domestic to the international sphere. Norway counts among its social sustainability goals the need to increase development assistance and imports from developing countries. Portugal’s national strategy includes guidelines for reinforcing development co-operation, especially with Portuguese speaking countries, and moving towards the target of devoting 0.7% of GDP to official development aid.\n",
