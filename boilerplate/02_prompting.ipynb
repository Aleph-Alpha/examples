    "Text: The \"Whiskey War\" is an ongoing conflict between Denmark and Canada over ownership of Hans Island. The dispute began in 1973, when Denmark and Canada reached an agreement on Greenland's borders. However, no settlement regarding Hans Island could be reached by the time the treaty was signed. Since then both countries have used peaceful means - such as planting their national flag or burying liquor - to draw attention to the disagreement.\n",

In the course of the 16 expeditions launched so far, the Moon, Mars, Mercury and Venus, among others, have been explored.

An example of this is optical character recognition (OCR), the recognition and processing of images containing text. Further processing and final classification of the image is often done using artificial intelligence methods. The goal of this field is to enable computers to process visual tasks that were previously reserved for humans.\n",
